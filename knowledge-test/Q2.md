# How REST API, MCP, can improve the AI use case.

REST APIs are the ones that connects AI to the real world. Without them, AI could only use their own knowledge they are trained on with their datasets. Some LLMs such as Perplexity might have a search engine feature built in but most LLMs does not support this. It's for this reason that REST APIs are useful since AI can fetch live information like the current weather, news headlines, trending features, and many more. It also allows AIs to take action by sending an email, posting to social media, or updating a user data on the database.

MCP takes it a step further by making the AI the one in charge of using those APIs. With my current workflow as an AI engineer, I do not tell the AI in detail on what specific tool to use on a specific case. The amount of cases in the world are endless and we can't cover them all. With MCP, we can give the full list of tools that the AI can browse and use on its own. Thanks to this, it allows us to give an AI a complex, multi-step goal. For example, they can plan a trip to Japan, check flight prices, and find a hotel near the beach. This is possible because they can figure out tools to use such as the flight API, the hotel API, and many more. It makes the AI far more flexible and powerful, allowing it to handle new tasks without a developer needing to write new code for every single possibility.
