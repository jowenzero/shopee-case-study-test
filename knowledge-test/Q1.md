# Describe differences between REST API, MCP in the context of AI.

In my usual workflow, I would describe REST APIs as a way for multiple pieces of software to communicate with each other. MCP on the other hand, is a more specialized way for an AI model to use external tools, acting as a list of capabilities the AI can read. While REST APIs are primarily used by us developers to connect these softwares together, which means we have to manually code every single connection and step ourselves, MCP lets the AI connect these external tools together on its own. It can figure out which tools to use and in what order, letting it find the data it needs to create the most optimal output possible.

Often times, an MCP would wrap REST APIs using custom tools, so it isn't really replacing REST, we're just adding some sort of "AI-friendly" layer on top. For example, an AI might need to read internal documents to gain further context of the current user prompt. Therefore, the AI would use a document search tool that has a REST API endpoint which talks to the vector database. The key difference is that with MCP, the AI can just ask what tools are available, see the document_search tool on the list, and decide to use it without a developer having to code that specific connection beforehand.
